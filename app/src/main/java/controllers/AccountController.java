        from which observers can be created by the calling class.

    /* TODO:  Write getUser(String email)
        Method will attempt to read the corresponding user object indicated by email parameter.
        Hopefully, will return an object that can be attached with observers. It should be noted
        that the failure of this method could be used to detect if dealing with a new user (and
        thus kick into the account creation process)
